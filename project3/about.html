    <h1>Game Treatment Proposal: <em>Slime Mold</em></h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>High Concept</h2>
        <p><em>Slime Mold</em> is a simple visual simulation representing the movement of cells within a petri dish, with movement akin to slime molds.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Genre</h2>
        <p>Visual, Educational, Singleplayer, Motivational</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Platform</h2>
        <p>Designed for Desktop Web, with potential for Mobile Web.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>An abstract simulation of a computer-generated slime mold. Slime mold is as slime mold does.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>The game will feature grid of tiles, which will be slowly covered by inactive green cells, and active blue cells. Aiming for a retro-lab-software aesthetic.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>Players will be able to define initial conditions within the petri dish, as well as click to place new inactive cells to stimulate the blue cells to continue growing. There is no "learning" how to play, simply playing around and experimenting.</p>
    </div>

        <h2>Mockups</h2>

<ul> <h2>Programming Notes</h2>
    <li>Getting this to work was a challenge. A welcome challenge, but a challenge nonetheless.</li>
    <li>When I went to work on an "invert" button, that changed all live cells to dead and vice versa, I realized that can't work. So now we have the Sanitize button.</li>
    <li>I completed the project, THEN realized I needed an ES6 class. Implementing one as the LifeWorld script took SO LONG.</li> 
</ul>
