II. Tell us about the 2 Audio Effect nodes you added to the audio routing graph.
    For my 2 audio effects, I instead went with three! Leveled distortion, a treble filter, and a bass filter!
    -
III. Tell us your Sprite's class name, what it looks like/what it does in the visualization
    The Sprite class is simply named sprite! It draws a right-facing triangle that moves across the canvas,
     changing speeds based on the frequency of the audio + a random variable for some variation.
     It's supposed to resemble spaceships! 

IV. Tell us what app data you put in your av-data.json file
    Within my av-data.json file, I have this data stored:
        - HTML Title
        - Audio File Locations
        - Audio File Names
        - Startup Parameters

V. Tell us how you improved the aesthetics of the app over the AV HW:
be sure to give yourself a grade for this section, between 0% and 15%
0% would be if there was not a meaningful improvement over the AV HW
15% would be substantial improvement over the AV HW - a "wow" (portfolio-worthy) experience
and everything in between

    I decided to go for a more galaxy-inspired audio visualizer! While the basic structure is the same, I've set up some random generation on the sprites,
    as well as an overhaul on the color palettes across the board! With a custom font, background color palette, and other small details, I tried to keep all the core functionality,
    while giving the whole visuals a revamp!
    I'd give myself a 12% because I didn't truly DO all that much fun stuff to the AV that wasn't necessary to begin with, but I think my implementation came out quite good!
